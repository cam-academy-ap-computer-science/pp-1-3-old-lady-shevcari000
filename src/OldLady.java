/****
 * Grading comments:
 *  Nice work.   The output was perfect, and you got rid of
 *  a little bit of duplication by the 'Space()' method, but
 *  I think you missed a bit of the point - in that the goal
 *  is to reduce the amount of typing you do by nesting the
 *  methods, and re-using the lines.  
 *  Compiles and works but misses the point:  14/15
 *  Output:  6/6 - really clean.
 *  Economy: 0/2 - Space(), but not alot of reduction of effort
 *  Consistency: 2/2  - remember to indent your last bracket. 
 *   You can get rid of the // TODO Auto-generated stub...
